# Data-Management-using-Spring-boot-with-JWT

## Overview

This project is a data management application built using Spring Boot. It features robust API development with JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication to ensure secure access to the application resources. The application provides CRUD operations for managing data entities and uses Flyway Migrator for database versioning and migrations.

## Features

Spring Boot: The backbone of the application, providing a streamlined and modular approach to developing Java applications.
JWT Authentication: Ensures secure access to the APIs by generating and validating tokens for user authentication.
CRUD Operations: Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for managing data entities.
Flyway Migrator: Manages database versioning and migrations, ensuring a smooth database schema evolution.
Exception Handling: Proper handling of exceptions to ensure smooth operation and user-friendly error messages.

## Technologies Used

Java 8: The core programming language used for development.
Spring Boot: Framework for creating stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based applications.
Spring Security: Used for implementing JWT-based authentication and authorization.
JWT (JSON Web Tokens): For securing APIs.
Flyway: For database migrations and version control.
Maven: For project build and dependency management.

## Prerequisites

JDK 8 or higher
